    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Rasgulla (literally "syrup filled ball") is a syrupy dessert popular in the eastern part of South Asia. It is made from ball-shaped dumplings of chhena dough, cooked in light sugar syrup made of sugar. This is done until the syrup permeates the dumplings,If you are intimidated by the idea of making rasgullas at home, please do not be any longer. I was too, until one day I tried it and realized I was worried for no reason all these years. They are quite easy and super quick to make. Give these a try.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>6 cups milk</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons fresh lime juice</li>
        <li>2 Â½ cups white sugar</li>
        <li>6 cups wate</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground cardamom</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring the milk to a boil in a heavy-bottomed pan till it starts foaming; immediately add the lime juice and stir. It will curdle right away. You should see the milk solids (chenna) separate from the whey. Pour into a colander lined with cheesecloth; rinse the chenna with cold water to get rid of the lime juice. Allow the water to drain completely.</li>
        <li>Gather the muslin cloth edges like a parcel and express as much water as possible; what you now have is soft paneer. Turn the paneer onto a rolling mat or other smooth surface. Knead the paneer well to make a smooth paste. Roll into a ball and divide into 20 equal portions.</li>
        <li>Bring the water to a boil in a pressure cooker; stir the sugar into the boiling water until dissolved.</li>
        <li>Roll each portion of paneer into a smooth ball between your palms, making sure there are no cracks; gently drop the balls into the hot syrup. Secure the lid onto the pressure cooker and bring to pressure. Reduce heat to medium-low and pressure cook for 6 minutes.</li>
        <li>Release the pressure from the cooker while running under water; remove the lid. The rasgullas should be floating on the syrup and have expanded 2 or 3 times in size. Pour the rasgullas and syrup into a bowl. Gently stir the cardamom into the mixture. Refrigerate to chill completely before serving cold.</li>
    </ol>
