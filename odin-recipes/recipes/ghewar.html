    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Ghevar or Ghewar is a Rajasthani cuisine disc-shaped sweet made from ghee, flour, and sugar syrup. It is traditionally associated with the month of Shravan and the Teej and Raksha Bandhan festivals.

    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 1/2 cup all purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 pieces ice cubes</li>
        <li>1/4 cup milk</li>
        <li>1/2 cup ghee</li>
        <li>1/2 cup ghee</li>
        <li>2 1/2 cup water</li>
        <li>1/8 teaspoon edible food color</li>
        <li>1 cup sugar</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>To begin with, you need to prepare the sugar syrup of one string consistency. Then, take a large wide bowl and add solidified ghee in it. Take one ice cube at a time and rub the ghee vigorously. Take more ice cubes as required till the ghee becomes very white in colour.</li>
        <li>Then add milk, flour and one cup water. Mix these ingredients to make a smooth batter. Dissolve food colour in water and add to the batter. Add more water as required. The consistency of the batter should be fairly thin.</li>
        <li>Then take an aluminium or steel cylindrical container. Make sure that its height is at least 12″ and diameter is of 5-6″. Fill half of the container with ghee. Heat it and once the ghee is hot enough, then take a 50 ml, a glassful of the batter. Pour in centre of ghee, slowly in one continuous thread-like stream. Allow the foam to settle.</li>
        <li>Pour one more glassful in a hole formed in the centre. When the foam settles again, loosen the Ghevar with an iron skewer inserted in the hole. Lift carefully at a slant and place on wire mesh to drain. Keep hot syrup in a wide flat-bottomed container to fit in the Ghevar. Then, dip the Ghevar in it and remove it to drain out the excess syrup. Then, keep aside on a mesh. This will take out the extra syrup.</li>
        <li>Alternatively, pour some syrup evenly all over, keeping Ghevar in a mesh placed over a container. Let it cool and settle down, then top it with edible silver foil. Splash a few drops of saffron milk, sprinkle some chopped dry fruits and 1 tsp of cardamom powder.</li>
    </ol>
